# 🧠 Hack The Box – First Impressions

I started exploring the blue team training labs on **Hack The Box (HTB)**, and here's what I think so far.

---

## 🔍 Why I Picked HTB

- Known for red team/offensive content, but they’re now adding **blue team modules**
- Wanted to reinforce **incident response** and **network detection skills**
- Needed something more practical than multiple-choice certs

---

## 🧰 What I’ve Tried So Far

- **Tier 0 Labs** – MITRE-based basics with detection workflows
- **Windows Logging & Analysis** – hunting down suspicious activity via logs
- **Packet Analysis** – digging into traffic with Wireshark and Zeek

---

## 💡 What I Like

- Immediate feedback on flags (real CTF-style structure)
- Clear learning paths by topic (SIEM, forensics, packet analysis)
- Hands-on, not hand-holding

---

## 🤔 What Could Be Better

- Some walkthroughs are still in development
- If you're brand new, the learning curve spikes quickly
- No centralized blue team dashboard or progress map (yet)

---

## 🔄 How I’m Using It

I'm using HTB as:
- A practical follow-up to theory-heavy certs like Google Cyber or SC-900
- A hands-on companion to my **Proxmox lab stack**
- A stepping stone to real-world detection engineering

---

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

HTB’s blue team content isn’t massive yet—but it’s **focused and growing**.  
For someone building skills in SOC workflows, log analysis, and real detection?  
**Absolutely worth using.**

Next up: feeding HTB logs into my own Security Onion instance and writing custom alerts.
