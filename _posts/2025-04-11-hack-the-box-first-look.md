title: "First Impressions of Hack The Box Training"

I've started going through the Hack The Box Training platform to build real, hands-on cybersecurity skills—focusing especially on blue team content and core security concepts.

## 🔍 What I’m Learning So Far

- Active Directory enumeration basics
- System hardening techniques
- Practical use of tools like `netstat`, `nmap`, and `Wireshark`
- How to analyze services and ports like a real analyst

## 💭 Thoughts on the Platform

- I like that it's structured and beginner-friendly but still technical
- The training feels more like a real environment than a quiz-style course
- Instant feedback and flags make it rewarding to push through challenges

## 📌 Goals

- Finish the Blue Team Pathway over the next month
- Take notes and apply knowledge to my home lab in Proxmox
- Start posting short walkthroughs of modules and what I learn from them
