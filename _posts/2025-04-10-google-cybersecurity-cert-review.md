# 🔐 Google Cybersecurity Certificate Review

I recently completed the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** on Coursera, and here’s my honest take.

---

## 🧠 What It Covers

- Basics of security concepts (CIA triad, risk management)
- Tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and Nessus
- Intro to SOC operations and incident response
- Linux, Windows, networking, Python, and SIEM basics

---

## 👍 What Was Good

- Very beginner-friendly and structured
- Instructors are clear and well-paced
- Final capstone ties together practical knowledge
- Actually engaging for a self-paced course

---

## 👎 What Fell Flat

- Too slow if you already have IT basics
- Hands-on sections are often just videos, not true labs
- No real log analysis or security detection exercises

---

## 🔧 How I Used It

I used this cert to:
- Refresh foundational terminology
- Build confidence before moving into harder blue team content
- Structure my lab documentation style and flow

---

## 🔚 Would I Recommend It?

Yes—**for beginners**, it’s a great launchpad.  
For intermediate learners? You’ll move fast, but you’ll still learn how to communicate like a SOC analyst.
