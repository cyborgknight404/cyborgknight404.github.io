The Google Cybersecurity Certificate was my first structured step into the world of cybersecurity. Here's what I learned and what I took away from it:

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways

- Strong foundation in security concepts like CIA triad, threat modeling, and incident response
- Real-world scenarios made it easier to understand abstract topics
- Loved the engaging format and hands-on feelâ€”it didnâ€™t talk *at* you, it walked *with* you

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Next

- Microsoft SC-900 and CompTIA Security+/Network+
- Applying what I learned in real labs via Hack The Box and TryHackMe
- Building out my home lab with Proxmox and open-source security tools
