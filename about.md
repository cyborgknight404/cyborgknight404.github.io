# 👤 About Me

I'm **Cyborg Knight**—a cybersecurity explorer focused on defensive operations, threat detection, and practical lab work. This site documents my growth, my experiments, and my obsession with understanding how things break (and how to stop them from breaking again).

---

## 🎯 What I’m Doing

- Building a **Proxmox-based home lab** with real log ingestion, network segmentation, and attack simulation
- Completing certifications like the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, **Security+**, **SC-900**, and **Network+**
- Practicing hands-on skills via **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, and self-hosted scenarios

## 🧠 Why Cybersecurity?

Because I like puzzles. Because I’ve always wanted to understand how systems work (and how people break them).  
Because keeping things safe isn't just a job—it's a challenge I enjoy solving.
