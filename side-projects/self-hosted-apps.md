## 🧰 What It Is

A collection of apps I run locally to replace cloud-based services—focusing on **data ownership**, **privacy**, and **technical self-reliance**. All hosted on my home lab stack using lightweight VMs or containers.

---

## 🧱 What I'm Running

- **📚 FreshRSS** – Self-hosted RSS reader to track infosec blogs, CVEs, and tech news
- **🔐 Vaultwarden** – Lightweight Bitwarden server alternative for password management
- **☁️ Nextcloud** – File sync and cloud storage replacement
- **🚫 Pi-hole** – DNS-based ad/tracker blocker for the whole network
- **🧭 Unbound** – Recursive DNS server for clean, fast name resolution

---

## 🤖 Why It Matters

- No subscriptions, no third-party analytics, no reliance on Big Tech uptime
- Forces you to think about real-world hosting, backup, and update workflows
- Easy wins for any aspiring blue teamer or homelabber

## 🔄 Ongoing Work

- 📊 Integrating app logs into Security Onion for monitoring
- 🔐 Exploring Tailscale/VPN for remote access to select services
- 🧪 Testing auto-update routines and failover scenarios

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Pi-hole and Unbound are surprisingly powerful in a secure DNS config
- Nextcloud needs tuning to avoid becoming a bloat monster
- RSS is still one of the best tools for staying sharp in this field
