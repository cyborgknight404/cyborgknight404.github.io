## 🍇 iMac G3 "Blueberry" Restoration

I found this vintage iMac G3 (Blueberry, 1999) and couldn’t resist the challenge of getting it powered, cleaned, and (at least partially) usable again.

## 🧼 Physical Restoration

- Full internal dust purge—had the smell of a RadioShack graveyard
- Polished the translucent shell and screen with plastic-safe cleaner
- Replaced PRAM battery to fix boot/reset issues
- Cleaned and reseated RAM and IDE connectors

---

## 🖥️ OS + Functionality

- Original OS 9 install was toast—rebuilt with **Mac OS 9.2.2**
- Bootable via internal IDE drive and external FireWire CD-ROM
- Can run legacy AppleWorks, Netscape Navigator, and some classic edutainment titles

## 💡 Why I Bothered

- Fun break from high-stakes lab builds
- Got a working retro system on my shelf that still boots!
- Good test of power troubleshooting, CRT safety, and old-school Mac boot sequences
- Sparks curiosity when people walk into the lab

---

## 🛠️ Possible Additions

- Create a minimalist web server running MacPerl just for fun
- Use as a novelty DHCP relay or static server
- Build a clear acrylic base or case mod for LED lighting
- Mirror the site’s blog as a static HTML replica on it, just because I can

## 📸 Status

Currently fully cleaned, restored, boots to Mac OS 9, and sits on my lab shelf as both a curiosity and a functioning machine.

Still makes the signature Mac *"bong"* when it powers on. Victory.
