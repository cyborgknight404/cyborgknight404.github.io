# ðŸ§ª Experimental & Side Projects

Not everything I work on is directly cybersecurity-related. This page tracks my other tech experimentsâ€”projects Iâ€™ve started, paused, or come back to thanks to curiosity, caffeine, or ADHD.

## ðŸ”§ Home Network Automation (WIP)

Using Pi-hole, Unbound, and Home Assistant to manage and monitor DNS, devices, and automations in my home network. Eventually planning to add VLAN segmentation and log forwarding.

## ðŸ’¾ Retro Mac Rebuild

Resurrecting a 2008 Mac Pro into a hybrid Proxmox lab and NAS.  
Includes hardware repair (drive bay rework), RAM upgrades, and bootloader wizardry.  
This machine will eventually host both home services and my blue team training lab.

## ðŸ“¦ Self-Hosted App Stack

Testing deployments of:
- **FreshRSS** â€“ for personal news aggregation
- **Vaultwarden** â€“ self-hosted password manager
- **Nextcloud** â€“ home file sync and productivity hub

Goal: Learn about containerized deployments, reverse proxies (NGINX), and self-reliant infrastructure.

## ðŸ§  Notes for Future Me

These projects help me explore beyond cyber certs, keep my hands dirty in tech, andâ€”criticallyâ€”give me something productive to bounce to when my brain needs a reset.

If Iâ€™ve paused something, itâ€™s probably not deadâ€”just reloading.
