## 🧪 Experimental & Side Projects

These aren’t directly cybersecurity-related, but they reflect my interest in tech, problem-solving, and hardware hacking.

### 🔧 Home Network Automation (WIP)
- Using Pi-hole, Unbound, and Home Assistant to manage and monitor my local network

### 💾 Retro Mac Rebuild
- Resurrecting a 2008 Mac Pro into a Proxmox-based lab and NAS

I document these projects both to track my own learning and to keep ADHD-driven pivots productive.
